# Boba Lover

This Web App was made with **React**, **Firebase** (for the cards data) & **Cohere's API**. One of the Chabox, we implemented a Cohere AI Chatbot using itâ€™s API.

## What is it about?
BobaLover is a platform created by the members of a passionate team, that aims to curate an experience for people trying out boba for the first-time and for professional boba-lovers alike. Our app **keeps track of the boba stores that you've liked**, and **allows you to communicate with them**! This creates a personalised experience for the viewer.

We wish to see a world where people invested in the boba experience have a place to start their journey! A place for them to belong!

## What we plan to do in the future
We plan to extend this app and branch into an environment where boba-lovers can interact with each other and plan boba-dates together! Furthermore, we plan to use an algorithm to sort and display boba locations based on your previous choices, helping you find more stores and flavours based on your previous choices.
